## 🔄 Upcoming Remake (v2)

TNS is evolving! A complete redesign is planned to improve scalability, maintainability, and cross-platform support.

> 🛠️ The project will be split into three parts:

* **Core (C++ DLL):** Handles all task logic and data operations
* **CLI (C++):** Terminal interface using the core as a dynamic library
* **GUI (QT):** Cross-platform graphical interface built on top of the core

This change will allow both terminal lovers and GUI users to benefit from the same powerful backend.

---

## 💡 Future Plans

* [ ] Modular core as a shared library (DLL)
* [ ] QT-based GUI (cross-platform)
* [ ] Command-line improvements (better UX)
* [ ] Settings system (themes, autosave, etc.)
* [ ] Database support (SQLite, optional)
* [ ] Installer / Deployment support
